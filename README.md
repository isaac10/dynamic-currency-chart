# dynamic-currency-chart

// Hello everyone. What I'm trying to accomplish is to create a table with currency quotes that refreshes automatically every
   "x" amount of time. I'm fairly certain this should be no major feat for some experienced programmers, but in my case it would
   take a lot of me to come up with it on my own. I need your help fellas! 
   
   What I'll include is my progress so far on the webpage I'm working. Its my first webpage I've built and would seriously
   appreciate any thoughts and criticism for the improvement of my work.
